# Alex Atienza
Hi, my name is **Alex Atienza** and I am a **second year** at **UCSD** with a major in **Computer Science (CS)** and a minor in **Design**.
## Computer Science
I developed an interest in CS during my last two years of highschool after my involvement in a program that exposes CS to students K-12. I hope to find what path to pursue as I continue my education at UCSD. Fun but not really fun fact, ever since I took the **CSE 20** course I started taking digital notes using `LaTeX`!
## Personal Life
I have a wide range of hobbies and interests, this includes:
> Dance, Cooking, Music, Video Editing, Graphic Design, Sushi
My favorite genres of music include:
> R&B, Rap, Hip-Hop, Pop-Punk, Indie Rock
One of my favorite cooking channels on YouTube is [You Suck At Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/@yousuckatcooking).
