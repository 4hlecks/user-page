# Alex Atienza
Hi, my name is **Alex Atienza** and I am a **second year** at **UCSD** with a major in **Computer Science (CS)** and a minor in **Design**.
## Computer Science
I developed an interest in CS during my last two years of highschool after my involvement in a program that exposes CS to students K-12. I hope to find what path to pursue as I continue my education at UCSD. I recently declared a Design minor as I have always had an interest in graphic design growing up which has granted some more motivation for me here at school! Fun but not really fun fact, ever since I took the **CSE 20** course I started taking digital notes using `LaTeX`! If I had to be honest and rank the programming languages I _enjoy_ from top to bottom, it would be:
1. Block-Based Coding
2. Python
3. Java
4. C
5. C++
6. Assembly

## Personal Life
I have a wide range of hobbies and interests, this includes:
> Dance, Cooking, Music, Video Editing, Graphic Design, Sushi

My favorite genres of music include:
- R&B
- Rap
- Hip-Hop
- Pop-Punk
- Indie Rock


One of my favorite cooking channels on YouTube is [You Suck At Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/@yousuckatcooking). 
As of recently, [Cherry Coke](images/cherrycoke.jpeg) has become my new favorite soda, but Root Beer is still great though.

Some of my goals in life are the following (mark the ones you have done!):
- [ ] Skydiving
- [ ] Perform on stage with a musical artist
- [ ] Buy my parents a mansion
- [ ] Do a backflip no spotter

Lastly here is a capybara with a hat!
